# Support

The Realm team is here to help you with your Realm-related issues!

## Documentation

Before asking questions, please familiarize yourself with our [Swift](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest) and [Objective-C](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest) documentation. We also have a number of [Tech Notes](https://realm.io/docs/tech-notes/) which cover various topics that may be of interest.

## Stack Overflow

If you have questions about configuring or using Realm you can ask them on Stack Overflow. We continually monitor the [`realm` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/realm). Please also tag your question with `ios`, `swift`, or other tags as appropriate.

When asking questions on Stack Overflow, please keep in mind Stack Overflow's [question guidelines](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask), and please use their search functionality to see if your question has been asked before.

## GitHub Issues

If you are running into issues with Realm, including potential bugs or feature requests, we encourage you to file an issue on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues). Please check out our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to properly file an issue.

We greatly appreciate demonstration projects that we can run for ourselves in order to see issues or potential bugs; we prioritize clearly-written tickets that include reproduction cases. You may attach these to the ticket; let us know if you need to share them confidentially, and weâ€™ll provide instructions on how to do so.
