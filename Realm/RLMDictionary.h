/**
 `RLMDictionary` is a container type in Realm representing a dynamic collection of key-value pairs.

 Unlike `NSDictionary`, `RLMDictionary`s hold a single key and value type.
 This is referred to in these docs as the “type” and “keyType” of the dictionary.

 When declaring an `RLMDictionary` property, the object type and keyType must be marked as conforming to a
 protocol by the same name as the objects it should contain.

     RLM_COLLECTION_TYPE(ObjectType)
     ...
     @property RLMDictionary<NSString *, ObjectType *><RLMString, ObjectType> *objectTypeDictionary;

 `RLMDictionary`s can be queried with the same predicates as `RLMObject` and `RLMResult`s.

 `RLMDictionary`s cannot be created directly. `RLMDictionary` properties on `RLMObject`s are
 lazily created when accessed, or can be obtained by querying a Realm.

 ### Key-Value Observing

 `RLMDictionary` supports dictionary key-value observing on `RLMDictionary` properties on `RLMObject`
 subclasses, and the `invalidated` property on `RLMDictionary` instances themselves is
 key-value observing compliant when the `RLMDictionary` is attached to a managed
 `RLMObject` (`RLMDictionary`s on unmanaged `RLMObject`s will never become invalidated).

 which keys in the dictionary were added, modified or deleted. If a write transaction

 notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple notifications may be
 coalesced into a single notification. This can include the notification
 with the initial results. For example, the following code performs a write
 transaction immediately after adding the notification block, so there is no
 opportunity for the initial notification to be delivered first. As a
 result, the initial notification will reflect the state of the Realm after
 the write transaction.
