/**
 `Object` is a class used to define Realm model objects.

 In Realm you define your model classes by subclassing `Object` and adding properties to be managed.
 You then instantiate and use your custom subclasses instead of using the `Object` class directly.

 ```swift
 class Dog: Object {
 @objc dynamic var name: String = ""
 @objc dynamic var adopted: Bool = false
 let siblings = List<Dog>()
 }
 ```

 ### Supported property types

 - `String`, `NSString`
 - `Int`
 - `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`
 - `Float`
 - `Double`
 - `Bool`
 - `Date`, `NSDate`
 - `Data`, `NSData`
 - `Decimal128`
 - `ObjectId`
 - `@objc enum` which has been delcared as conforming to `RealmEnum`.
 - `RealmOptional<Value>` for optional numeric properties
 - `Object` subclasses, to model many-to-one relationships
 - `EmbeddedObject` subclasses, to model owning one-to-one relationships
 - `List<Element>`, to model many-to-many relationships

 `String`, `NSString`, `Date`, `NSDate`, `Data`, `NSData`, `Decimal128`, and `ObjectId`  properties
 can be declared as optional. `Object` and `EmbeddedObject` subclasses *must* be declared as optional.
 `Int`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, `Float`, `Double`, `Bool`,  enum, and `List` properties cannot.
 To store an optional number, use `RealmOptional<Int>`, `RealmOptional<Float>`, `RealmOptional<Double>`, or
 `RealmOptional<Bool>` instead, which wraps an optional numeric value. Lists cannot be optional at all.

 All property types except for `List` and `RealmOptional` *must* be declared as `@objc dynamic var`. `List` and
 `RealmOptional` properties must be declared as non-dynamic `let` properties. Swift `lazy` properties are not allowed.

 Note that none of the restrictions listed above apply to properties that are configured to be ignored by Realm.

 ### Querying

 You can retrieve all objects of a given type from a Realm by calling the `objects(_:)` instance method.

 ### Relationships

 See our [Objective-C guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sdk/swift/fundamentals/relationships/) for more details.

/**
 `EmbeddedObject` is a base class used to define embedded Realm model objects.

 Embedded objects work similarly to normal objects, but are owned by a single
 parent Object (which itself may be embedded). Unlike normal top-level objects,
 embedded objects cannot be directly created in or added to a Realm. Instead,
 they can only be created as part of a parent object, or by assigning an
 unmanaged object to a parent object's property. Embedded objects are
 automatically deleted when the parent object is deleted or when the parent is
 modified to no longer point at the embedded object, either by reassigning an
 Object property or by removing the embedded object from the List containing it.

 Embedded objects can only ever have a single parent object which links to
 them, and attempting to link to an existing managed embedded object will throw
 an exception.

 The property types supported on `EmbeddedObject` are the same as for `Object`,
 except for that embedded objects cannot link to top-level objects, so `Object`
 and `List<Object>` properties are not supported (`EmbeddedObject` and
 `List<EmbeddedObject>` *are*).

 Embedded objects cannot have primary keys or indexed properties.

 ```swift
 class Owner: Object {
 @objc dynamic var name: String = ""
 let dogs = List<Dog>()
 }
 class Dog: EmbeddedObject {
 @objc dynamic var name: String = ""
 @objc dynamic var adopted: Bool = false
 let owner = LinkingObjects(fromType: Owner.self, property: "dogs")
 }
 ```

/**
 `AsymmetricObject` is a base class used to define asymmetric Realm objects.

 Asymmetric objects can only be created using the `create(_ object:)`
 function, and cannot be added, removed or queried.
 When created, asymmetric objects will be synced unidirectionally to the MongoDB
 database and cannot be accessed locally.

 Incoming links from any asymmetric table are not allowed, meaning embedding
 an asymmetric object within an `Object` will throw an error.

 The property types supported on `AsymmetricObject` are the same as for `Object`,
 except for that asymmetric objects can only link to embedded objects, so `Object`
 and `List<Object>` properties are not supported (`EmbeddedObject` and
 `List<EmbeddedObject>` *are*).

 ```swift
 class Person: AsymmetricObject {
     @Persisted(primaryKey: true) var _id: ObjectId = ObjectId.generate()
     @Persisted var name: String
     @Persisted var age: Int
 }
 ```
