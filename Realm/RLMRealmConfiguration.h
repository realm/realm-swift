 An `RLMRealmConfiguration` instance describes the different options used to
 create an instance of a Realm.

 `RLMRealmConfiguration` instances are just plain `NSObject`s. Unlike `RLMRealm`s
 and `RLMObject`s, they can be freely shared between threads as long as you do not
 mutate them.

 Creating configuration objects for class subsets (by setting the
 `objectClasses` property) can be expensive. Because of this, you will normally want to
 cache and reuse a single configuration object for each distinct configuration rather than
 creating a new object each time you open a Realm.

/**
 The maximum number of live versions in the Realm file before an exception will
 be thrown when attempting to start a write transaction.

 Realm provides MVCC snapshot isolation, meaning that writes on one thread do
 not overwrite data being read on another thread, and instead write a new copy
 of that data. When a Realm refreshes it updates to the latest version of the
 data and releases the old versions, allowing them to be overwritten by
 subsequent write transactions.

 Under normal circumstances this is not a problem, but if the number of active
 versions grow too large, it will have a negative effect on the filesize on
 disk. This can happen when performing writes on many different threads at
 once, when holding on to frozen objects for an extended time, or when
 performing long operations on background threads which do not allow the Realm
 to refresh.

 Setting this property to a non-zero value makes it so that exceeding the set
 number of versions will instead throw an exception. This can be used with a
 low value during development to help identify places that may be problematic,
 or in production use to cause the app to crash rather than produce a Realm
 file which is too large to be oened.

 will not be copied and the already existing realm will be opened instead.

 Note that to use this parameter with a synced Realm configuration
 the seed Realm must be appropriately copied to a destination with
 `[RLMRealm writeCopyForConfiguration:]` first.

 This option is mutually exclusive with `inMemoryIdentifier`. Setting a `seedFilePath`
