/**
 A `RLMInteger` represents an integer property on a `RLMObject` subclass
 that supports advanced Realm-specific functionality.

 `RLMInteger` properties are backed by integer columns within the underlying
 database, and are treated the same as normal 64-bit integer properties. No
 migration is required to go change a property of `NSNumber<RLMInt>` or `int`
 type into one of `RLMInteger` type, or vice versa; however, nullability must
 be preserved.

 Increment the value of the integer. Both negative and positive values can
 be passed in.

 Prefer incrementing an integer value using this API over getting, locally
 incrementing, and setting the integer value. This API allows the value to
 be incremented in a way that guarantees that the change will not be lost,
 even if other clients are incrementing the value and pushing their changes
 to a Realm Object Server, as long as the value is not also being set using
 the `value` property.

 @warning If the value of the integer is nil, an exception will be thrown.
