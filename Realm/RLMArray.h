/**
 `RLMArray` is the container type in Realm used to define to-many relationships.

 Unlike an `NSArray`, `RLMArray`s hold a single type, specified by the `objectClassName` property.
 This is referred to in these docs as the “type” of the array.

 When declaring an `RLMArray` property, the type must be marked as conforming to a
 protocol by the same name as the objects it should contain (see the
 `RLM_COLLECTION_TYPE` macro). In addition, the property can be declared using Objective-C
 generics for better compile-time type safety.

     RLM_COLLECTION_TYPE(ObjectType)
     ...
     @property RLMArray<ObjectType *><ObjectType> *arrayOfObjectTypes;

 `RLMArray`s can be queried with the same predicates as `RLMObject` and `RLMResult`s.

 `RLMArray`s cannot be created directly. `RLMArray` properties on `RLMObject`s are
 lazily created when accessed, or can be obtained by querying a Realm.

 ### Key-Value Observing

 `RLMArray` supports array key-value observing on `RLMArray` properties on `RLMObject`
 subclasses, and the `invalidated` property on `RLMArray` instances themselves is
 key-value observing compliant when the `RLMArray` is attached to a managed
 `RLMObject` (`RLMArray`s on unmanaged `RLMObject`s will never become invalidated).

 Because `RLMArray`s are attached to the object which they are a property of, they
 do not require using the mutable collection proxy objects from
 `-mutableArrayValueForKey:` or KVC-compatible mutation methods on the containing
 object. Instead, you can call the mutation methods on the `RLMArray` directly.

 Registers a block to be called each time the array changes.

 The block will be asynchronously called with the initial array, and then
 called again after each write transaction which changes any of the objects in
 the array, which objects are in the results, or the order of the objects in the
 array.

 The `changes` parameter will be `nil` the first time the block is called. For
 each call after that, it will contain information about which rows in the
 array were added, removed or modified. If a write transaction did not modify
 any objects in the array, the block is not called at all. See the

 reported and an example of updating a `UITableView`.

 The error parameter is present only for backwards compatiblity and will always
 be `nil`.

 Notifications are delivered via the standard run loop, and so can't be
 delivered while the run loop is blocked by other activity. When
 notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple notifications may be
 coalesced into a single notification. This can include the notification
 with the initial results. For example, the following code performs a write
 transaction immediately after adding the notification block, so there is no
 opportunity for the initial notification to be delivered first. As a
 result, the initial notification will reflect the state of the Realm after
 the write transaction.
