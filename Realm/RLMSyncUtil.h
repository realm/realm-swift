    /**
     An error that indicates the Realm needs to be reset.

     A synced Realm may need to be reset because MongoDB Realm encountered an
     error and had to be restored from a backup. If the backup copy of the remote Realm
     is of an earlier version than the local copy of the Realm, the server will ask the
     client to reset the Realm.

     The reset process is as follows: the local copy of the Realm is copied into a recovery
     directory for safekeeping, and then deleted from the original location. The next time
     the Realm for that partition value is opened, the Realm will automatically be re-downloaded from
     MongoDB Realm, and can be used as normal.

     Data written to the Realm after the local copy of the Realm diverged from the backup
     remote copy will be present in the local recovery copy of the Realm file. The
     re-downloaded Realm will initially contain only the data present at the time the Realm
     was backed up on the server.

     The client reset process can be initiated in one of two ways.
     
     The `userInfo` dictionary contains an opaque token object under the key
     `kRLMSyncErrorActionTokenKey`. This token can be passed into
     `+[RLMSyncSession immediatelyHandleError:]` in order to immediately perform the client
     reset process. This should only be done after your app closes and invalidates every
     instance of the offending Realm on all threads (note that autorelease pools may make this
     difficult to guarantee).

     If `+[RLMSyncSession immediatelyHandleError:]` is not called, the client reset process
     will be automatically carried out the next time the app is launched and the
     `RLMSyncManager` is accessed.

     The value for the `kRLMSyncPathOfRealmBackupCopyKey` key in the `userInfo` dictionary
     describes the path of the recovered copy of the Realm. This copy will not actually be
     created until the client reset process is initiated.

     @see `-[NSError rlmSync_errorActionToken]`, `-[NSError rlmSync_clientResetBackedUpRealmPath]`

     error domain.

     have read access to.
     
     This error may also occur if a user incorrectly opens a Realm they have read-only
     permissions to without using the `asyncOpen()` APIs.

     A Realm that suffers a permission denied error is, by default, flagged so that its
     local copy will be deleted the next time the application starts.
