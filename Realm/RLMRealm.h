/**
 An `RLMRealm` instance (also referred to as "a Realm") represents a Realm
 database.

 Realms can either be stored on disk (see `+[RLMRealm realmWithURL:]`) or in
 memory (see `RLMRealmConfiguration`).

 `RLMRealm` instances are cached internally, and constructing equivalent `RLMRealm`
 objects (for example, by using the same path or identifier) multiple times on a single thread
 within a single iteration of the run loop will normally return the same
 `RLMRealm` object.

 If you specifically want to ensure an `RLMRealm` instance is
 destroyed (for example, if you wish to open a Realm, check some property, and
 then possibly delete the Realm file and re-open it), place the code which uses
 the Realm within an `@autoreleasepool {}` and ensure you have no other
 strong references to it.

 @warning Non-frozen `RLMRealm` instances are thread-confined and cannot be
 shared across threads or dispatch queues. Trying to do so will cause an
 exception to be thrown. You must call this method on each thread you want to
 interact with the Realm on. For dispatch queues, this means that you must call
 it in each block which is dispatched, as a queue is not guaranteed to run all
 of its blocks on the same thread.
