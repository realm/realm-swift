/**
 A `RLMSectionedResultsChange` object encapsulates information about changes to sectioned
 results that are reported by Realm notifications.

 `RLMSectionedResultsChange` is passed to the notification blocks registered with
 `-addNotificationBlock` on `RLMSectionedResults`, and reports what sections and rows in the
 collection changed since the last time the notification block was called.

 A complete example of updating a `UITableView` named `tv`:

     [tv beginUpdates];
     [tv deleteRowsAtIndexPaths:changes.deletions withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
     [tv insertRowsAtIndexPaths:changes.insertions withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
     [tv reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:changes.modifications withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
     [tv insertSections:changes.sectionsToInsert withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
     [tv deleteSections:changes.sectionsToRemove withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic];
     [tv endUpdates];

 All of the arrays in an `RLMSectionedResultsChange` are always sorted in ascending order.

/**
 Registers a block to be called each time the section changes.

 The block will be asynchronously called with the initial sectioned results collection,
 and then called again after each write transaction which changes either any
 of the objects in the results, or which objects are in the results.

 The `change` parameter will be `nil` the first time the block is called.
 For each call after that, it will contain information about
 which rows in the section were added, removed or modified. If a
 write transaction did not modify any objects in the section,
 the block is not called at all. See the `RLMSectionedResultsChange` documentation for
 information on how the changes are reported and an example of updating a
 `UITableView`.

 If an error occurs the block will be called with `nil` for the results
 parameter and a non-`nil` error. Currently the only errors that can occur are
 when opening the Realm on the background worker thread.

 At the time when the block is called, the `RLMSection` object will be fully
 evaluated and up-to-date.

 Notifications are delivered via the standard run loop, and so can't be
 delivered while the run loop is blocked by other activity. When
 notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple notifications may be
 coalesced into a single notification. This can include the notification
 with the initial results. For example, the following code performs a write
 transaction immediately after adding the notification block, so there is no
 opportunity for the initial notification to be delivered first. As a
 result, the initial notification will reflect the state of the Realm after
 the write transaction.

    RLMResults<Dog *> *results = [Dog allObjects];
    RLMSectionedResults<Dog *> *sectionedResults = [results sectionedResultsUsingKeyPath:@"age" ascending:YES];
    RLMSection<Dog *> *section = sectionedResults[0]; // Objects already exist for Dog.
    self.token = [results addNotificationBlock:^(RLMSectionedResults *sectionedResults, RLMSectionedResultsChange *changes,
                                   NSError *error) {
         // Only fired once for the example
         NSLog(@"sectionedResults.count: %zu", sectionedResults.count); // => 1
     }];
     [realm transactionWithBlock:^{
         Dog *dog = [[Dog alloc] init];
         dog.name = @"Rex";
         dog.age = 5;
         [realm addObject:dog];
     }];
     // end of run loop execution context

 You must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to continue
 to be sent to the block. To stop receiving updates, call `-invalidate` on the token.

 @warning This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when the
          containing Realm is read-only.

 @param block The block to be called whenever a change occurs.
 @return A token which must be held for as long as you want updates to be delivered.
