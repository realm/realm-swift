#pragma mark - Notifications

/**
 Registers a block to be called each time the set changes.

 The block will be asynchronously called with the initial set, and then
 called again after each write transaction which changes any of the objects in
 the set, which objects are in the results, or the order of the objects in the
 set.

 The `changes` parameter will be `nil` the first time the block is called.
 For each call after that, it will contain information about
 which rows in the set were added, removed or modified. If a write transaction
 did not modify any objects in the set, the block is not called at all.
 See the `RLMCollectionChange` documentation for information on how the changes
 are reported and an example of updating a `UITableView`.

 The error parameter is present only for backwards compatiblity and will always
 be `nil`.

 Notifications are delivered via the standard run loop, and so can't be
 delivered while the run loop is blocked by other activity. When
 notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple notifications may be
 coalesced into a single notification. This can include the notification
 with the initial results. For example, the following code performs a write
 transaction immediately after adding the notification block, so there is no
 opportunity for the initial notification to be delivered first. As a
 result, the initial notification will reflect the state of the Realm after
 the write transaction.

     Person *person = [[Person allObjectsInRealm:realm] firstObject];
     NSLog(@"person.dogs.count: %zu", person.dogs.count); // => 0
