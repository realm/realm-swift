/**
 A task object which can be used to observe or cancel an async open.

 When a synchronized Realm is opened asynchronously, the latest state of the
 Realm is downloaded from the server before the completion callback is invoked.
 This task object can be used to observe the state of the download or to cancel
 it. This should be used instead of trying to observe the download via the sync
 session as the sync session itself is created asynchronously, and may not exist
 yet when -[RLMRealm asyncOpenWithConfiguration:completion:] returns.
