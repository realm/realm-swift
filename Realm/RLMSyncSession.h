 Register a progress notification block.

 Multiple blocks can be registered with the same session at once. Each block

 If the session has already received progress information from the
 synchronization subsystem, the block will be called immediately. Otherwise, it
 will be called as soon as progress information becomes available.

 The token returned by this method must be retained as long as progress
 notifications are desired, and the `-invalidate` method should be called on it
 when notifications are no longer needed and before the token is destroyed.

 If no token is returned, the notification block will never be called again.
 There are a number of reasons this might be true. If the session has previously
 experienced a fatal error it will not accept progress notification blocks. If
 the block was configured in the `RLMSyncProgressForCurrentlyOutstandingWork`
 mode but there is no additional progress to report (for example, the number
 of transferrable bytes and transferred bytes are equal), the block will not be
 called again.
