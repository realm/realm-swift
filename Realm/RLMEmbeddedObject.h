/**
 `RLMEmbeddedObject` is a base class used to define Realm model objects.

 Embedded objects work similarly to normal objects, but are owned by a single
 parent Object (which itself may be embedded). Unlike normal top-level objects,
 embedded objects cannot be directly created in or added to a Realm. Instead,
 they can only be created as part of a parent object, or by assigning an
 unmanaged object to a parent object's property. Embedded objects are
 automatically deleted when the parent object is deleted or when the parent is
 modified to no longer point at the embedded object, either by reassigning an
 RLMObject property or by removing the embedded object from the array containing
 it.

 Embedded objects can only ever have a single parent object which links to them,
 and attempting to link to an existing managed embedded object will throw an
 exception.

 The property types supported on `RLMEmbeddedObject` are the same as for
 `RLMObject`, except for that embedded objects cannot link to top-level objects,
 so `RLMObject` and `RLMArray<RLMObject>` properties are not supported
 (`RLMEmbeddedObject` and `RLMArray<RLMEmbeddedObject>` *are*).

 Embedded objects cannot have primary keys or indexed properties.

#pragma mark - Notifications

/**
 Registers a block to be called each time the object changes.

 The block will be asynchronously called after each write transaction which
 deletes the object or modifies any of the managed properties of the object,
 including self-assignments that set a property to its existing value.

 For write transactions performed on different threads or in differen
 processes, the block will be called when the managing Realm is
 (auto)refreshed to a version including the changes, while for local write
 transactions it will be called at some point in the future after the write
 transaction is committed.

 Notifications are delivered via the standard run loop, and so can't be
 delivered while the run loop is blocked by other activity. When notifications
 can't be delivered instantly, multiple notifications may be coalesced into a
 single notification.

 Unlike with `RLMArray` and `RLMResults`, there is no "initial" callback made
 after you add a new notification block.

 Only objects which are managed by a Realm can be observed in this way. You
 must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to be sent to
 the block. To stop receiving updates, call `-invalidate` on the token.

 It is safe to capture a strong reference to the observed object within the
 callback block. There is no retain cycle due to that the callback is retained
 by the returned token and not by the object itself.

 @warning This method cannot be called during a write transaction, when the
          containing Realm is read-only, or on an unmanaged object.

 @param block The block to be called whenever a change occurs.
 @return A token which must be held for as long as you want updates to be delivered.
