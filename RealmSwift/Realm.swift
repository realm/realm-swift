/**
 A `Realm` instance (also referred to as "a Realm") represents a Realm database.

 Realms can either be stored on disk (see `init(path:)`) or in memory (see `Configuration`).

 `Realm` instances are cached internally, and constructing equivalent `Realm` objects (for example,
 by using the same path or identifier) produces limited overhead.

 If you specifically want to ensure a `Realm` instance is destroyed (for example, if you wish to
 open a Realm, check some property, and then possibly delete the Realm file and re-open it), place
 the code which uses the Realm within an `autoreleasepool {}` and ensure you have no other strong
 references to it.

 - warning Non-frozen `RLMRealm` instances are thread-confined and cannot be
 shared across threads or dispatch queues. Trying to do so will cause an
 exception to be thrown. You must obtain an instance of `RLMRealm` on each
 thread or queue you want to interact with the Realm on. Realms can be confined
 to a dispatch queue rather than the thread they are opened on by explicitly
 passing in the queue when obtaining the `RLMRealm` instance. If this is not
 done, trying to use the same instance in multiple blocks dispatch to the same
 queue may fail as queues are not always run on the same thread.
