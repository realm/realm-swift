/**
 `PropertyType` is an enum describing all property types supported in Realm models.

 For more information, see [Realm Models](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#models).

 ### Primitive types

 * `Int`
 * `Bool`
 * `Float`
 * `Double`

 ### Object types

 * `String`
 * `Data`
 * `Date`
 * `Decimal128`
 * `ObjectId`

 ### Relationships: Array (in Swift, `List`) and `Object` types

 * `Object`
 * `Array`

    /**
     Registers a block to be called each time the object changes.

     The block will be asynchronously called after each write transaction which
     deletes the object or modifies any of the managed properties of the object,
     including self-assignments that set a property to its existing value.

     For write transactions performed on different threads or in different
     processes, the block will be called when the managing Realm is
     (auto)refreshed to a version including the changes, while for local write
     transactions it will be called at some point in the future after the write
     transaction is committed.

     If no key paths are given, the block will be executed on any insertion,
     modification, or deletion for all object properties and the properties of
     any nested, linked objects. If a key path or key paths are provided,
     then the block will be called for changes which occur only on the
     provided key paths. For example, if:
     ```swift
     class Dog: Object {
         @Persisted var name: String
         @Persisted var adopted: Bool
         @Persisted var siblings: List<Dog>
     }

     // ... where `dog` is a managed Dog object.
     dog.observe(keyPaths: ["adopted"], { changes in
        // ...
     })
     ```
     - The above notification block fires for changes to the
     `adopted` property, but not for any changes made to `name`.
     - If the observed key path were `["siblings"]`, then any insertion,
     deletion, or modification to the `siblings` list will trigger the block. A change to
     `someSibling.name` would not trigger the block (where `someSibling`
     is an element contained in `siblings`)
     - If the observed key path were `["siblings.name"]`, then any insertion or
     deletion to the `siblings` list would trigger the block. For objects
     contained in the `siblings` list, only modifications to their `name` property
     will trigger the block.

     - note: Multiple notification tokens on the same object which filter for
     separate key paths *do not* filter exclusively. If one key path
     change is satisfied for one notification token, then all notification
     token blocks for that object will execute.

     If no queue is given, notifications are delivered via the standard run
     loop, and so can't be delivered while the run loop is blocked by other
     activity. If a queue is given, notifications are delivered to that queue
     instead. When notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple
     notifications may be coalesced into a single notification.

     Unlike with `List` and `Results`, there is no "initial" callback made after
     you add a new notification block.

     Only objects which are managed by a Realm can be observed in this way. You
     must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to be sent
     to the block. To stop receiving updates, call `invalidate()` on the token.

     It is safe to capture a strong reference to the observed object within the
     callback block. There is no retain cycle due to that the callback is
     retained by the returned token and not by the object itself.

     - warning: This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when
                the containing Realm is read-only.
     - parameter keyPaths: Only properties contained in the key paths array will trigger
                           the block when they are modified. If `nil`, notifications
                           will be delivered for any property change on the object.
                           String key paths which do not correspond to a valid a property
                           will throw an exception.
                           See description above for more detail on linked properties.
     - parameter queue: The serial dispatch queue to receive notification on. If
                        `nil`, notifications are delivered to the current thread.
     - parameter block: The block to call with information about changes to the object.
     - returns: A token which must be held for as long as you want updates to be delivered.
