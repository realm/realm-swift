     Registers a block to be called each time the dictionary changes.

     The block will be asynchronously called with the initial dictionary, and then called again after each write
     transaction which changes either any of the keys or values in the dictionary.

     The `change` parameter that is passed to the block reports, in the form of keys within the dictionary, which of
     the key-value pairs were added, removed, or modified during each write transaction.

     At the time when the block is called, the dictionary will be fully evaluated and up-to-date, and as long as you do
     not perform a write transaction on the same thread or explicitly call `realm.refresh()`, accessing it will never
     perform blocking work.

     If no queue is given, notifications are delivered via the standard run loop, and so can't be delivered while the
     run loop is blocked by other activity. If a queue is given, notifications are delivered to that queue instead. When
     notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple notifications may be coalesced into a single notification.
     This can include the notification with the initial collection.

     For example, the following code performs a write transaction immediately after adding the notification block, so
     there is no opportunity for the initial notification to be delivered first. As a result, the initial notification
     will reflect the state of the Realm after the write transaction.

     ```swift
     let myStringMap = myObject.stringMap

     let token = myStringMap.observe { changes in
         switch changes {

             // Will print "myStringMap.count: 1"
             print("myStringMap.count: \(myStringMap.count)")
            print("Dog Name: \(myStringMap["nameOfDog"])") // => "Rex"
             break

         myStringMap["nameOfDog"] = "Rex"
     }
     // end of run loop execution context
     ```

     You must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to be sent to the block. To stop receiving
     updates, call `invalidate()` on the token.

     - warning: This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when the containing Realm is read-only.
     - parameter queue: The serial dispatch queue to receive notification on. If
                        `nil`, notifications are delivered to the current thread.

     If no key paths are given, the block will be executed on any insertion,
     modification, or deletion for all object properties and the properties of
     any nested, linked objects. If a key path or key paths are provided,
     then the block will be called for changes which occur only on the
     provided key paths. For example, if:
     ```swift
     class Dog: Object {
         @Persisted var name: String
         @Persisted var age: Int
         @Persisted var toys: List<Toy>
     }
     // ...
     let dogs = myObject.mapOfDogs
     let token = dogs.observe(keyPaths: ["name"]) { changes in
         switch changes {
         case .initial(let dogs):
            // ...
         case .update:
            // This case is hit:
            // - after the token is initialized
            // - when the name property of an object in the
            // collection is modified
            // - when an element is inserted or removed
            //   from the collection.
            // This block is not triggered:
            // - when a value other than name is modified on
            //   one of the elements.
         case .error:
             // ...
         }
     }
     // end of run loop execution context
     ```
     - If the observed key path were `["toys.brand"]`, then any insertion or
     deletion to the `toys` list on any of the collection's elements would trigger the block.
     Changes to the `brand` value on any `Toy` that is linked to a `Dog` in this
     collection will trigger the block. Changes to a value other than `brand` on any `Toy` that
     is linked to a `Dog` in this collection would not trigger the block.
     Any insertion or removal to the `Dog` type collection being observed
     would also trigger a notification.
     - If the above example observed the `["toys"]` key path, then any insertion,
     deletion, or modification to the `toys` list for any element in the collection
     would trigger the block.
     Changes to any value on any `Toy` that is linked to a `Dog` in this collection
     would *not* trigger the block.
     Any insertion or removal to the `Dog` type collection being observed
     would still trigger a notification.

     - note: Multiple notification tokens on the same object which filter for
     separate key paths *do not* filter exclusively. If one key path
     change is satisfied for one notification token, then all notification
     token blocks for that object will execute.

     You must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to be sent to the block. To stop receiving
     updates, call `invalidate()` on the token.

     - warning: This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when the containing Realm is read-only.

     - parameter keyPaths: Only properties contained in the key paths array will trigger
                           the block when they are modified. If `nil`, notifications
                           will be delivered for any property change on the object.
                           String key paths which do not correspond to a valid a property
                           will throw an exception.
                           See description above for more detail on linked properties.
     - note: The keyPaths parameter refers to object properties of the collection type and
             *does not* refer to particular key/value pairs within the collection.
     - parameter queue: The serial dispatch queue to receive notification on. If
                        `nil`, notifications are delivered to the current thread.
     - parameter block: The block to be called whenever a change occurs.
