    Memberwise convenience initializer for SyncTimeoutOptions. All values are

    - Parameters:
      - connectTimeout: The maximum time to allow for a connection to become
        fully established. This includes the time to resolve the network
        address, the TCP connect operation, the SSL handshake, and the
        WebSocket handshake.
      - connectionLingerTime: If session multiplexing is enabled, how long to
        keep connections open while there are no active session.
      - pingKeepalivePeriod: How long to wait between each ping message sent to
        the server. The client periodically sends ping messages to the server
        to check if the connection is still alive. Shorter periods make
        connection state change notifications more responsive at the cost of
        battery life (as the antenna will have to wake up more often).
      - pongKeepaliveTimeout: How long to wait for the server to respond to a
        ping message. Shorter values make connection state change notifications
        more responsive, but increase the chance of spurious disconnections.
      - fastReconnectLimit: When a client first connects to the server, it
        downloads all data from the server before it begins to upload local
        changes. This typically reduces the total amount of merging needed and
        gets the local client into a useful state faster. If a disconnect and
        reconnect happens within the time span of the fast reconnect limit,
        this is skipped and the session behaves as if it were continuously
        connected.

     - parameter clientResetMode: Determines file recovery behavior during a client reset. `.recoverUnsyncedChanges` by default.
     - parameter initialSubscriptions: A block which receives a subscription set instance, that can be used to add an
                                       initial set of subscriptions which will be executed when the Realm is first opened.
     - parameter rerunOnOpen:          If true, allows to run the initial set of subscriptions specified, on every app startup.
                                       This can be used to re-run dynamic time ranges and other queries that require a
