/**
 `Object` is a class used to define Realm model objects.

 In Realm you define your model classes by subclassing `Object` and adding properties to be managed.
 You then instantiate and use your custom subclasses instead of using the `Object` class directly.

 ```swift
 class Dog: Object {
     @Persisted var name: String
     @Persisted var adopted: Bool
     @Persisted var siblings: List<Dog>
 }
 ```

 ### Supported property types

 - `String`
 - `Int`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`
 - `Float`
 - `Double`
 - `Bool`
 - `Date`
 - `Data`
 - `Decimal128`
 - `ObjectId`
 - `UUID`
 - `AnyRealmValue`
 - Any RawRepresentable enum whose raw type is a legal property type. Enums
   must explicitly be marked as conforming to `PersistableEnum`.
 - `Object` subclasses, to model many-to-one relationships
 - `EmbeddedObject` subclasses, to model owning one-to-one relationships

 All of the types above may also be `Optional`, with the exception of
 `AnyRealmValue`. `Object` and `EmbeddedObject` subclasses *must* be Optional.

 In addition to individual values, three different collection types are supported:
 - `List<Element>`: an ordered mutable collection similar to `Array`.
 - `MutableSet<Element>`: an unordered uniquing collection similar to `Set`.
 - `Map<String, Element>`: an unordered key-value collection similar to `Dictionary`.

 The Element type of collections may be any of the supported non-collection
 property types listed above. Collections themselves may not be Optional, but
 the values inside them may be, except for lists and sets of `Object` or
 `EmbeddedObject` subclasses.

 Finally, `LinkingObjects` properties can be used to track which objects link
 to this one.

 All properties which should be stored by Realm must be explicitly marked with
 `@Persisted`. Any properties not marked with `@Persisted` will be ignored
 entirely by Realm, and may be of any type.

 ### Querying

 You can retrieve all objects of a given type from a Realm by calling the `objects(_:)` instance method.

 ### Relationships

 See our [Swift guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sdk/swift/fundamentals/relationships/) for more details.

     This will set a different persisted property name on the Realm, and allows using the public name
     for any operation with the property. (Ex: Queries, Sorting, ...).
     This very helpful if you need to map property names from your `Device Sync` JSON schema
     to local property names.

     ```swift
     class Person: Object {

     }
     ```

     - note: Only property that have a different column name have to be added to the properties mapping
     dictionary.
     - note: In a migration block, when enumerating an old property with a public/private name, you will have to use
     the old column name instead of the public one to retrieve the property value.

     ```swift
     let migrationBlock = { migration, oldSchemaVersion in

            // Use this value in migration
         })
     }
     ```
     This has to be done as well when renaming a property.
     ```swift
     let migrationBlock = { migration, oldSchemaVersion in
         migration.renameProperty(onType: "Person", from: "first_name", to: "complete_name")

    /**
     Registers a block to be called each time the object changes.

     The block will be asynchronously called after each write transaction which
     deletes the object or modifies any of the managed properties of the object,
     including self-assignments that set a property to its existing value.

     For write transactions performed on different threads or in different
     processes, the block will be called when the managing Realm is
     (auto)refreshed to a version including the changes, while for local write
     transactions it will be called at some point in the future after the write
     transaction is committed.

     If no key paths are given, the block will be executed on any insertion,
     modification, or deletion for all object properties and the properties of
     any nested, linked objects. If a key path or key paths are provided,
     then the block will be called for changes which occur only on the
     provided key paths. For example, if:
     ```swift
     class Dog: Object {
         @Persisted var name: String
         @Persisted var adopted: Bool
         @Persisted var siblings: List<Dog>
     }

     // ... where `dog` is a managed Dog object.
     dog.observe(keyPaths: ["adopted"], { changes in
        // ...
     })
     ```
     - The above notification block fires for changes to the
     `adopted` property, but not for any changes made to `name`.
     - If the observed key path were `["siblings"]`, then any insertion,
     deletion, or modification to the `siblings` list will trigger the block. A change to
     `someSibling.name` would not trigger the block (where `someSibling`
     is an element contained in `siblings`)
     - If the observed key path were `["siblings.name"]`, then any insertion or
     deletion to the `siblings` list would trigger the block. For objects
     contained in the `siblings` list, only modifications to their `name` property
     will trigger the block.

     - note: Multiple notification tokens on the same object which filter for
     separate key paths *do not* filter exclusively. If one key path
     change is satisfied for one notification token, then all notification
     token blocks for that object will execute.

     If no queue is given, notifications are delivered via the standard run
     loop, and so can't be delivered while the run loop is blocked by other
     activity. If a queue is given, notifications are delivered to that queue
     instead. When notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple
     notifications may be coalesced into a single notification.

     Unlike with `List` and `Results`, there is no "initial" callback made after
     you add a new notification block.

     Only objects which are managed by a Realm can be observed in this way. You
     must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to be sent
     to the block. To stop receiving updates, call `invalidate()` on the token.

     It is safe to capture a strong reference to the observed object within the
     callback block. There is no retain cycle due to that the callback is
     retained by the returned token and not by the object itself.

     - warning: This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when
                the containing Realm is read-only.
     - parameter keyPaths: Only properties contained in the key paths array will trigger
                           the block when they are modified. If `nil`, notifications
                           will be delivered for any property change on the object.
                           String key paths which do not correspond to a valid a property
                           will throw an exception.
                           See description above for more detail on linked properties.
     - parameter queue: The serial dispatch queue to receive notification on. If
                        `nil`, notifications are delivered to the current thread.
     - parameter block: The block to call with information about changes to the object.

     Returns whether two Realm objects are the same.

     Objects are considered the same if and only if they are both managed by the same
     Realm and point to the same underlying object in the database.

     - note: Equality comparison is implemented by `isEqual(_:)`. If the object type
             is defined with a primary key, `isEqual(_:)` behaves identically to this
             method. If the object type is not defined with a primary key,
             `isEqual(_:)` uses the `NSObject` behavior of comparing object identity.
             This method can be used to compare two objects for database equality
             whether or not their object type defines a primary key.

     - parameter object: The object to compare the receiver to.
