/**
 `Object` is a class used to define Realm model objects.

 In Realm you define your model classes by subclassing `Object` and adding properties to be managed.
 You then instantiate and use your custom subclasses instead of using the `Object` class directly.

 ```swift
 class Dog: Object {
     @Persisted var name: String
     @Persisted var adopted: Bool
     @Persisted var siblings: List<Dog>
 }
 ```

 ### Supported property types

 - `String`
 - `Int`, `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`
 - `Float`
 - `Double`
 - `Bool`
 - `Date`
 - `Data`
 - `Decimal128`
 - `ObjectId`
 - `UUID`
 - `AnyRealmValue`
 - Any RawRepresentable enum whose raw type is a legal property type. Enums
   must explicitly be marked as conforming to `PersistableEnum`.
 - `Object` subclasses, to model many-to-one relationships
 - `EmbeddedObject` subclasses, to model owning one-to-one relationships

 All of the types above may also be `Optional`, with the exception of
 `AnyRealmValue`. `Object` and `EmbeddedObject` subclasses *must* be Optional.

 In addition to individual values, three different collection types are supported:
 - `List<Element>`: an ordered mutable collection similar to `Array`.
 - `MutableSet<Element>`: an unordered uniquing collection similar to `Set`.
 - `Map<String, Element>`: an unordered key-value collection similar to `Dictionary`.

 The Element type of collections may be any of the supported non-collection
 property types listed above. Collections themselves may not be Optional, but
 the values inside them may be, except for lists and sets of `Object` or
 `EmbeddedObject` subclasses.

 Finally, `LinkingObjects` properties can be used to track which objects link
 to this one.

 All properties which should be stored by Realm must be explicitly marked with
 `@Persisted`. Any properties not marked with `@Persisted` will be ignored
 entirely by Realm, and may be of any type.

 ### Querying

 You can retrieve all objects of a given type from a Realm by calling the `objects(_:)` instance method.

 ### Relationships

 See our [Cocoa guide](http://realm.io/docs/cocoa) for more details.

     The block will be asynchronously called after each write transaction which
     deletes the object or modifies any of the managed properties of the object,
     including self-assignments that set a property to its existing value.

     For write transactions performed on different threads or in different
     processes, the block will be called when the managing Realm is
     (auto)refreshed to a version including the changes, while for local write
     transactions it will be called at some point in the future after the write
     transaction is committed.

     If no queue is given, notifications are delivered via the standard run
     loop, and so can't be delivered while the run loop is blocked by other
     activity. If a queue is given, notifications are delivered to that queue
     instead. When notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple
     notifications may be coalesced into a single notification.

     Unlike with `List` and `Results`, there is no "initial" callback made after
     you add a new notification block.

     Only objects which are managed by a Realm can be observed in this way. You
     must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to be sent
     to the block. To stop receiving updates, call `invalidate()` on the token.

     It is safe to capture a strong reference to the observed object within the
     callback block. There is no retain cycle due to that the callback is
     retained by the returned token and not by the object itself.

     - warning: This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when
     the containing Realm is read-only.
     - parameter queue: The serial dispatch queue to receive notification on. If
     `nil`, notifications are delivered to the current thread.
