///  ### Supported property types
///
/// Projection can transform the original `@Persisted` properties in several ways:
/// - `Passthrough` - `Projection`'s property will have same name and type as original object. See `PersonProjection.firstName`.
/// - `Rename` - Projection's property will have same type as original object just with the new name.
/// - `Keypath resolution` - you can access the certain properties of the projected `Object`. See `PersonProjection.lastNameCaps` and `PersonProjection.homeCity`.
/// - `Collection mapping` - `List` and `MutableSet`of `Object`s or `EmbeddedObject`s  can be projected as a collection of primitive values.
///     See `PersonProjection.friendsFirstName`.
/// - `Exclusion` - all properties of the original Realm object that were not defined in the projection model will be excluded from projection.
///     Any changes happened on those properties will not trigger a change notification for the `Projection`.
///     You still can access the original `Object` or `EmbeddedObject` and observe notifications directly on it.
/// - note: each `@Persisted` property can be `@Projected` in different ways in the same Projection class.
/// Each `Object` or `EmbeddedObject` can have sevaral projections of same or different classes at once.
///
/// ### Querying
///
/// You can retrieve all Projections of a given type from a Realm by calling the `objects(_:)` of Realm or `init(projecting:)`
/// of Projection's class:
///
/// ```swift
/// let projections = realm.object(PersonProjection.self)
/// let personObject = realm.create(Person.self)
/// let singleProjection = PersonProjection(projecting: personObject)
/// ```

    /**
     Registers a block to be called each time the projection's underlying object changes.

     The block will be asynchronously called after each write transaction which
     deletes the underlying object or modifies any of the projected properties of the object,
     including self-assignments that set a property to its existing value.

     For write transactions performed on different threads or in different
     processes, the block will be called when the managing Realm is
     (auto)refreshed to a version including the changes, while for local write
     transactions it will be called at some point in the future after the write
     transaction is committed.

     If no key paths are given, the block will be executed on any insertion,
     modification, or deletion for all projected  properties, including projected properties of
     any nested, linked objects. If a key path or key paths are provided,
     then the block will be called for changes which occur only on the
     provided key paths. For example, if:

     ```swift
     class Person: Object {
         @Persisted var firstName: String
         @Persisted var lastName = ""
         @Persisted public var friends: List<Person>
     }

     class PersonProjection: Projection<Person> {
         @Projected(\Person.firstName) var name
         @Projected(\Person.lastName.localizedUppercase) var lastNameCaps
         @Projected(\Person.friends.projectTo.firstName) var firstFriendsName: ProjectedCollection<String>
     }

     let token = projectedPerson.observe(keyPaths: ["name"], { changes in
        // ...
     })
     ```
     - The above notification block fires for changes to the
     `Person.firstName` property of the the projection's underlying `Person` Object,
     but not for any changes made to `Person.lastName` or `Person.friends` list.
     - The notification block fires for changes of `PersonProjection.name` property, but not  for
     another projection's property change.
     - If the observed key path were `["firstFriendsName"]`, then any insertion,
     deletion, or modification of the `firstName` of the `friends` list will trigger the block. A change to
     `someFriend.lastName` would not trigger the block (where `someFriend`
     is an element contained in `friends`)

     - note: Multiple notification tokens on the same object which filter for
     separate key paths *do not* filter exclusively. If one key path
     change is satisfied for one notification token, then all notification
     token blocks for that object will execute.

     If no queue is given, notifications are delivered via the standard run
     loop, and so can't be delivered while the run loop is blocked by other
     activity. If a queue is given, notifications are delivered to that queue
     instead. When notifications can't be delivered instantly, multiple
     notifications may be coalesced into a single notification.

     Unlike with `List` and `Results`, there is no "initial" callback made after
     you add a new notification block.

     You must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to be sent
     to the block. To stop receiving updates, call `invalidate()` on the token.

     It is safe to capture a strong reference to the observed object within the
     callback block. There is no retain cycle due to that the callback is
     retained by the returned token and not by the object itself.

     - warning: This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when
                the containing Realm is read-only.
     - warning: For projected properties where the original property has the same root property name,
                this will trigger a `PropertyChange` for each of the Projected properties even though
                the change only corresponds to one of them.
                For the following `Projection` object
                ```swift
                class PersonProjection: Projection<Person> {
                    @Projected(\Person.firstName) var name
                    @Projected(\Person.address.country) originCountry
                    @Projected(\Person.address.phone.number) mobile
                }

                let token = projectedPerson.observe { changes in
                    if case .change(_, let propertyChanges) = changes {
                        propertyChanges[0].newValue as? String, "Winterfell" // Will notify the new value
                        propertyChanges[1].newValue as? String, "555-555-555" // Will notify with the current value, which hasn't change.
                    }
                })

                try realm.write {
                    person.address.country = "Winterfell"
                }
                ```

     - parameter keyPaths: Only properties contained in the key paths array will trigger
                           the block when they are modified. If `nil`, notifications
                           will be delivered for any projected property change on the object.
                           String key paths which do not correspond to a valid projected property
                           will throw an exception.
     - parameter queue: The serial dispatch queue to receive notification on. If
                        `nil`, notifications are delivered to the current thread.
     - parameter block: The block to call with information about changes to the object.
     - returns: A token which must be held for as long as you want updates to be delivered.

     `someFriend.lastName` would not trigger the block (where `someFriend`
     is an element contained in `friends`)

     Notifications are delivered to a function isolated to the given actor, on that
     actors executor. If the actor is performing blocking work, multiple
     notifications may be coalesced into a single notification.

     Unlike with Collection notifications, there is no "Initial" notification
     and there is no gap between when this function returns and when changes
     will first be captured.

     You must retain the returned token for as long as you want updates to be sent
     to the block. To stop receiving updates, call `invalidate()` on the token.

     - warning: This method cannot be called during a write transaction, or when
                the containing Realm is read-only.
     - parameter keyPaths: Only properties contained in the key paths array will trigger

                           will be delivered for any projected property change on the object.
                           String key paths which do not correspond to a valid projected property
                           will throw an exception.
     - parameter actor: The actor which notifications should be delivered on. The
                        block is passed this actor as an isolated parameter,
                        allowing you to access the actor synchronously from within the callback.
     - parameter block: The block to call with information about changes to the object.
     - returns: A token which must be held for as long as you want updates to be delivered.

     Registers a block to be called each time the projection's underlying object changes.

     The block will be asynchronously called on the actor after each write transaction which
     deletes the underlying object or modifies any of the projected properties of the object,
     including self-assignments that set a property to its existing value.

     For write transactions performed on different threads or in different
     processes, the block will be called when the managing Realm is
     (auto)refreshed to a version including the changes, while for local write
     transactions it will be called at some point in the future after the write
     transaction is committed.

     If no key paths are given, the block will be executed on any insertion,
     modification, or deletion for all projected  properties, including projected properties of
     any nested, linked objects. If a key path or key paths are provided,
     then the block will be called for changes which occur only on the
     provided key paths. For example, if:

     ```swift
     class Person: Object {
         @Persisted var firstName: String
         @Persisted var lastName = ""
         @Persisted public var friends: List<Person>
     }

     class PersonProjection: Projection<Person> {
         @Projected(\Person.firstName) var name
         @Projected(\Person.lastName.localizedUppercase) var lastNameCaps
         @Projected(\Person.friends.projectTo.firstName) var firstFriendsName: ProjectedCollection<String>
     }

     let token = projectedPerson.observe(keyPaths: [\PersonProjection.name], { changes in
        // ...
     })
     ```
     - The above notification block fires for changes to the
     `Person.firstName` property of the the projection's underlying `Person` Object,
     but not for any changes made to `Person.lastName` or `Person.friends` list.
     - The notification block fires for changes of `PersonProjection.name` property, but not  for
     another projection's property change.
     - If the observed key path were `[\.firstFriendsName]`, then any insertion,
     deletion, or modification of the `firstName` of the `friends` list will trigger the block. A change to
     `someFriend.lastName` would not trigger the block (where `someFriend`
     is an element contained in `friends`)

     Notifications are delivered to a function isolated to the given actor, on that
     actors executor. If the actor is performing blocking work, multiple
     notifications may be coalesced into a single notification.

     Unlike with Collection notifications, there is no "Initial" notification
