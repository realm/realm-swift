            The goal of TightDB is to provide a high performance
            data storage for your applications. 

            TightDB integrates seamless in Objective-C, making it
            fast to learn and easy to use.  You can replace your traditional data
            structures with TightDB. Whether it is a simple array of integers or a
            complex structure, you interface to TightDB as easily as using a
            standard array like container. But in addition you can
            handle much more data in much less space, you get powerful query
            possibilities in an intuitive language and the ability to share your data
            across all supported languages and platforms.

            The core of the framework is the class {@link class_table}. The
            class is a representation of the
            fundamental concept <strong>Table</strong>. You can use 
            {@link class_table} in the situations where you know the table structure 
            a priori or when the data structure changes dynamically through the run time
            of the application.

            Tables organize data in columns and rows and data is compacted for
            low memory usage. The interface to the data resembles the native
            data structures. Moreover, tables can have nested tables as data. Using subtables
            and mixed types you can build arbitrarily complex data structures.

            It is possible to query data using the {@link class_query} and 
            class. Queries can be complex - involving
            any number of columns and values. You can either apply aggregate functions to you
            resulting data set or use the data set in your application as a
            {@link class_tableview} object.

            The {@link class_group} class lets you serialize tables to disk or memory. The
            TightDB data format is consistent across operating systems, hardware platforms,
            and programming languages. This implies that you can share data across applications
            and environments. For multi-threaded or multi-process applications, you can
            use the {@link class_shared_group}.
